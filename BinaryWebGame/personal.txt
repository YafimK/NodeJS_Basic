**Hard**


**EASY**
well mostly this exercise wasn't that hard at all - espcially since i've learned JQuery for ex2.


**General course comments**
The course was overly good - but i think we should get most exercies before and maybe switch ex 2 and 3...
switch it to four ex's.
Maybe instead of exam - make the course like PostPc course (android) with project at it's end, like building some kind of web app or something else to make this knowledge to use.
For students, it will be a great thign to invest in - anothor work for the GitHub profile :)
