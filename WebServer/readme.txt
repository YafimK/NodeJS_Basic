Please Note: we got extension unti Sat 21.1.2017


1. The first steps of the basic skeletion desgin were hard.
How to connect between request response, where we should locate
each funcion and module. Basiclly the base design of the project.
The parssing process was also challnaging.


2. The socket handling process was very intrsting and brought us
to another level of understaing in node.js

3. First we check timeout.
Than we check the matcing process of basic url such as helloworld see
that the next function operates correctly, using http module creating automatic
request and response trigerring the send or json functions.
Than we examine some more complex url including parmas verfied that the match parsing
operates correctly and same a before we invoke auomatic request and responses using
http module of js. 
Than we verified that we parse data correctly given the content tpye.
Finally we check the all read file mechnizem.
